Revision history for Perl extension MarpaX::Languages::Dash.

1.00  2016-12-25T12:00:00
	- Renamed from MarpaX::Languages::Dash V 2.03, because the old name does not convey the real
		purpose of this module.
	- Remove use of 'use utf8' and 'use open ...', since they are global.
	- Switch from File::Slurp to File::Slurper.
